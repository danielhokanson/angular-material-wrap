# Project Overview

## Purpose

Angular Material Wrap is a dual-purpose Angular project that serves as both:

1. **A library** - Distributable Angular components and services
2. **A demo application** - Showcasing the library's capabilities

## Goals

- Create reusable Angular Material wrapper components
- Provide a comprehensive demo application
- Maintain clear separation between library and demo code
- Enable easy development and testing workflows

## Target Audience

- Angular developers who need Material Design components
- Developers looking for examples of library + demo app architecture
- Contributors to the project

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Component Library**: 40+ components across controls and complex components
- **Signal-Based APIs**: Modern Angular signal inputs/outputs for reactive, type-safe property binding
- **Material Design 3**: Complete M3 implementation with dynamic theming
- **Controls**: 18 form controls (button, input, select, checkbox, radio, slider, switch, chips, datepicker, timepicker, textarea, autocomplete, file-input, toggle, range-slider, color-picker, form-validation)
- **Components**: 23 layout/display components (card, tabs, dialog, popover, accordion, sidenav, stepper, menu, toolbar, icon, divider, progress-bar, progress-spinner, calendar, data-table)
- **Dual Build System**: Separate builds for library and demo app
- **Modern Angular**: Uses Angular 21+ with standalone components
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with strict configuration
- **SCSS Architecture**: BEM methodology with consistent naming conventions
- **Cypress E2E Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end test coverage
- **Comprehensive Demo**: Complete demo application showcasing all capabilities
